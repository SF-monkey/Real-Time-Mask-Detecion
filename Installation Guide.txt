1. Install python 3.8.0 x64, https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.0/python-3.8.0-amd64.exe.
Make sure to add the python folder to the Windows user environment PATH:
https://geek-university.com/python/add-python-to-the-windows-path/

2. For trainning the model, install python packages:
tensorflow, keras, numpy, opencv-python, matplotlib, scipy, sklearn

For running the webcam realtime mask detector only, you need to install:
tensorflow, keras, numpy, opencv-python, scipy

3. Install CUDA 10.1 as this is the latest version supporting tensorflow 2.x

4. Install cudnn-10.1-windows10-x64-v7.6.1.34, and unzip the file in default CUDA dir:
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.1

5. If you are using IDEs like PyCharm, unzip the code and dataset in a folder, then setup the interpreter.
For the base interpreter, select python 3.8.0 x64 we just install. And check mark "Inherit global site-packages" if you pip install the packages in system default dir.

6. Check and make sure Windows has ALL Visual C++ redistributable packages x86 and x64 installed.

7. Steps 3 and 4 will make sure the code is running with a CUDA cabable GPU, without CUDA and cuDNN the code can still run but would require a CPU for computing; Step 5 is optional as the py file can be executed simply by itself.
